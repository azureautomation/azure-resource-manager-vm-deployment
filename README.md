Azure Resource Manager VM Deployment
====================================

            

Updated to accomodate changes in the Azure PowerShell Module.


The attached script uses a gui to deploy VM's and its associated resources quickly. The latest ARM modules is required. The script makes use of Powershell Workflows to deply in parallel. The script allows you to do offline config and deploy when you have
 all your machines set. The idea of it is to easily deploy a resourge group with 1 or many VM's quickly. Automation Accounts is best for this script.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
